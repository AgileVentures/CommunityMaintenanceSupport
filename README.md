## Completed so Far

* Analysis of Slack activity in the three weeks leading up to Premium signup -> saw a possible trend of increasing activituy
* Ranking of Slack users by number of posts in a given week, and associated email domains

## ToDo

* Weighed ranking over multiple weeks (looking for increasing activity)
* Logistic regression (identify predictors)
* Automated contacting? (send "how are you doing" to anyone in the top ranked users, who has not had a DM with a mentor that week)
* refactor code to short methods, more self documenting?
